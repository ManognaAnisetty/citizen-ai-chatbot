# 🇮🇳 Citizen AI – Intelligent Citizen Engagement Chatbot

**Citizen AI** is a smart, AI-powered chatbot built using **IBM Watson Assistant** to help users interact with citizen services like Aadhaar, Voter ID, PAN card, and more. The chatbot uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand user queries and provide instant, human-like responses.

1. User opens the chatbot website.
2. A script loads Watson Assistant and renders the chat widget.
3. User types a question (e.g., "How to apply for voter ID?")
4. Watson Assistant uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to detect intent.
5. A matching action is triggered and Watson replies accordingly.
